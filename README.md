# Watsky_Word_Grids

Hey!

I've been a huge Watsky fan for the past decade or so, and I think the way he has formatted his most recent albums is super fascinating (see below).
As can be seen the words can be read in the rows or the columns.


COM PLA INT


PLA  CEM ENT


INT  ENT ION

I made this code to find these word grids with various sizes and partitions. To run the code, run "main.py" with the latest python version.

I hope you enjoy! :)

Also thank you to the mieliestronk website for supplying their list of 58,000 words.
